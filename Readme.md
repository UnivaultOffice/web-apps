# UnivaultOffice web-apps

## Overview

Welcome to the `web-apps` repository.

This repository contains the frontend (UI) for **UnivaultOffice Document Server** and **UnivaultOffice Desktop Editors**. It powers the interface you use to create, edit, save, and export text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, forms, and PDF files.

## How it fits in the UnivaultOffice ecosystem

| Layer | Component | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| Engine | [Document Server](https://github.com/UnivaultOffice/DocumentServer) | Editing logic, file conversion, real-time collaboration |
| Interface | **Web Apps** (this repo) | Browser-based user interface |
| Integrations | [Integration API](https://api.univaultoffice.github.io/docs/docs-api/get-started/basic-concepts/) | Embeds editors into web apps and platforms |

Together, these layers form the core of **UnivaultOffice**.

## Key highlights

- Multiple editors from a single codebase (text, spreadsheets, presentations, forms, PDF).
- Real-time collaboration: co-editing, comments, mentions, and version history.
- Extensible UI with plugins and integrations.
- The same UI code is reused in Desktop Editors and the browser-based Document Server.
